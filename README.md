# Parking Attendent #

## Problem: ##

Campus Parking assistant: Create a web site/service that allows students to quickly get a list of available parking spots on campus. Focus on the method of requesting and retrieving this information. For the sake of this exercise, assume that currently available slots are known to you.

## Rationale ##

Parking has become a large issue. A way for students to learn which parking lots are unoccupied would be a boon. Data collected from some kind of application could also be processed so that trends could be established that could help make decisions on where new lots should be constructed.

A mobile interface where users could access the data in near real time is a must, as this will be the most useful medium.
Using a mobile *web* interface is a low cost solution that can be used on a wide variety of mobile platforms, and also on larger desktops/laptops.

Automating parking lot detection will be at least one of: expensive, inaccurate. Crowdsourcing data is a cheaper (and, if done right, more effective) alternative.

The greatest challenge with crowdsourcing data is encouraging your users to submit data. 

In this application users have an incentive to submit data for their own benefit. This can be augmented with systems like a Badge system where users gain "Badges" for certain accomplishments. Having monetary or other kinds of prizes would also encourage users to submit data (and overall would be much cheaper than an automated solution.)
